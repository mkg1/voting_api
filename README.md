# Voting API

## Description

Code to create an API using Rails which allows users to vote for one candidate for public office.

## Functions

/candidates/index: Displays list of all candidates
/candidates/show: Displays first candidate
/candidates/create: Creates a new candidate and adds to database

### Estimates
I anticipate the second part of the assignment will take about 6 hours, including learning about token authentication and getting more comfortable with the rails framework.
